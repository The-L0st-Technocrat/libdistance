Description: Development files for libdistance
 The distance library is used to compare pieces of data for similarity.
 Specifically, it contains a number of methods to find the "edit distance"
 between inputs, or the number of differences between them. These
 differences are calculated using various mechanisms. The inputs to these
 functions can be character strings or arbitrary data.
